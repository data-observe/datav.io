title: Add navigation to sidebar
description: 
---

Find dashbaords by searching is really easy. As comparasion, add navigation is not that easy, but it's much more powerful.

If you look at the top section of sidebar, you will find there are much room left, the reason is that we can add our own navigation items to sidebar.

## Team 

Before we add our own navigation items, we need to know what is `Team` in xObserve. 

Every dashboard belongs to a team. In default, dashboards we created are owned by `global` team, which is the default team.

<img src={require('@/img/docs/tutorial/dashboard-team.jpg').default.src} alt="dashboard-team"  className="rounded-lg ring-1 ring-black/5"  style={{height: "60px"}}/>

Each team can has its own sidebar, the default sidebar we use is belongs to `global` team. So if you does not specify a team when you do something, e.g create a dashboard, everything will default belongs to `global` team.

For more information about team, please refer to [Team tutorial](/docs/tutorial-team). For now, you just need to know that we are operating everthing in `global` team.


## Modify sidebar 

As we are using sidebar which belongs to `global` team, we need to modify the sidebar in `global` team page.

1. Click `configuration` icon in the bottom section of sidebar, this will open the configuration panel, or you can just click the `Add new item` icon in top section of the sidebar, this icon will be 
 disappeared when we add our first navigation item.

2. In last step, if you choose to  click the `configuration` icon, then select `Team` tab, you should see below image

<img src={require('@/img/docs/tutorial/team-manage.jpg').default.src} alt="team-manage"  className="rounded-lg ring-1 ring-black/5"  width={3086} height={1658}/>

3. Click `manage` button in `global` team row and select `Side Menu` tab

4. Try to add menu items as below image 

<img src={require('@/img/docs/tutorial/manage-sidebar.jpg').default.src} alt="manage-sidebar"  className="rounded-lg ring-1 ring-black/5"  width={3086} height={1658}/>

You may wonder how can we get the dashboard id, the simplest way is copy it from `search` panel: search the dashboard you want, hover on its card and click copy icon.

<img src={require('@/img/docs/tutorial/copy-dashboard-id.jpg').default.src} alt="copy-dashboard-id"  className="rounded-lg ring-1 ring-black/5"  style={{height: "200px"}}/>

5. Click `Submit` button


When doing this, current page will be automatically refreshed, and you will see the new navigation item: 

<img src={require('@/img/docs/tutorial/new-sidemenu-item.jpg').default.src} alt="new-sidemenu-item"  className="rounded-lg ring-1 ring-black/5"  style={{height: "200px"}}/>


## Expand sidebar to width mode

When you have more sidebar items, especially when they have secondary children items,  maybe expand the sidebar is a nice choice, as the user can clearly see what is in the sidebar,rather then hover on a icon to see it .

Click on the xObserve logo in top of sidebar to see what will happens.


<img src={require('@/img/docs/tutorial/expand-sidebar.jpg').default.src} alt="expand-sidebar"  className="rounded-lg ring-1 ring-black/5"  style={{width: "150px"}}/>

That's cool, everything is clearly presented in our view, but.. how can we collapse it? 

If looking carefully, you will find there is a `<` icon in the top right corner of sidebar when being expanded, click it will collapse the sidebar to mini mode.
