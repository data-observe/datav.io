title: Query data from Prometheus

The dashboard we created in previous docs is powerful, but it has a huge limitation: it query data from Testdata datasource, which is a fake datasource. It's time to use real datasource to build a real dashboard.

In this doc, we will use [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/)  as datasource to build a dashboard, so you **need**:

<TextList>
    <li>**Install prometheus first**, and make sure the Prometheus server is running.</li>
    <li>**Start the node_exporter** binary in prometheus directory, this service will collect cpu,memory,disk,network info from your machine.</li>
</TextList>


Let's assume Prometheus is running on `http://localhost:9090` . First, we need to create a new datasource for Prometheus.

 

## Create Prometheus datasource

Click `+` button in the bottom section of sidebar, and select `New Datasource` tab.

Then fill the form as below: 

<img src={require('@/img/docs/tutorial/create-prometheus-ds.jpg').default.src} alt="create-prometheus-ds" style={{height: '500px'}}className="rounded-lg ring-1 ring-black/5" />

Click `Save & Test` button, if everything is ok, you will see a green message `Datasource is added, redirecting..` in the bottom of the form. 

Then the page will redirect to datasources managing page: 

<img src={require('@/img/docs/tutorial/datasource-managing.jpg').default.src} alt="datasource-managing" width={3086} height={1658} className="rounded-lg ring-1 ring-black/5" />

You can see Prometheus datasource is listed in the table, next to the default Testdata datasource which we used in previous docs.

## Select panel datasource

Before querying data from Prometheus, we need to create a new dashboard first, let's name it 'Hosts info'.

Then add a new table named `go gc info` , open panel editor and select `Graph` visulization.

Look at the `Query` tab on the left bottom of panel editor, you can see the default datasource is `Testdata` currently, we need to change it to `Prometheus` .

## Query data from Prometheus

From panel name, we can know that this panel is used to query go gc info from Prometheus, so we need to write a PromQL query to get the data, there are two ways:

### Write PromQL query manually

Find a input box which prompt you `Enter a PromQL query` , and then type `go_gc_duration_seconds` , you will see the result as below.

<img src={require('@/img/docs/tutorial/enter-prometheus-query.jpg').default.src} alt="enter-prometheus-query" width={3086} height={1658} className="rounded-lg ring-1 ring-black/5" />

### Select metrics from metrics list

Have you noticed the red line in the above image ? We can select metrics from there, click the red line, and then select `go_gc_duration_seconds` , you will see the same result as above image.

<img src={require('@/img/docs/tutorial/select-metrics.jpg').default.src} alt="select-metrics" style={{height: '400px'}}className="rounded-lg ring-1 ring-black/5" />


## Legend

We can change `Graph` legend names by using `Prometheus` legend, let's create a new panel named: Cpu idle, and then open panel editor, select `Graph` visulization and `Prometheus` datasource.

This panel will show  cpu idle usage of our host servers, to achive this, type `sum(rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode="idle"}[1m])) by (instance) / sum(rate(node_cpu_seconds_total[1m])) by (instance) * 100` in PromQL input box, 

then set legend to `cpu idle - {{instance}}`, result is as below: 


<img src={require('@/img/docs/tutorial/prometheus-legend.jpg').default.src} alt="prometheus-legend" width={3086} height={1658} className="rounded-lg ring-1 ring-black/5" />

In above result, `{{instance}}` is  replaced by `instance` label value in query result.

> Don't forget to add units to `cpu idle` panel, `%` is a good choice.
