We just learn how to use dashboard variables, they are powerful, but they have limitations: dashboard variable can only be used in the dashboard where they are defined.

Assuming we have two dashboard: server hosts and network traffic, they are all about host monitoring, so they should share a same variable: <Code>host</Code>: when we set `host` to `A` in a dashboard, then we switch to another dashboard, we want the `host` variable to be `A` too.

In a word: all dahsobards share a same variable and the same selected value.

Global variables and Dashboard variables share the same syntax, the only difference is that Global variables are defined out of dashboards.

## Create global variables

Let's create a global variable named `host`:

1. Click `configuration` icon in the bottom section of sidebar and select `Variable` tab

<img src={require('@/img/docs/tutorial/global-vars.jpg').default.src} alt="global-vars" width={3086} height={1658} className="rounded-lg ring-1 ring-black/5" />


2. Click `New variable` button to open variable editor
3. Fill in the form as below

<img src={require('@/img/docs/tutorial/edit-host-var.jpg').default.src} alt="edit-host-var" style={{height: '600px'}} className="rounded-lg ring-1 ring-black/5" />


aha, looks exactly the same as dashboard variable, so you should be familiar with it.

Yep, `host` is just another `instance`, it is the same as `instance` variable we created in previous doc, only difference is that `host` is a global variable, it can be used in any dashboard.

Click `Submit` button, you should see it appears in global variables table.

<img src={require('@/img/docs/tutorial/global-vars-table.jpg').default.src} alt="global-vars-table" width={3086} height={1658} className="rounded-lg ring-1 ring-black/5" />


## Use global variables 

Using global variable is also the same as dashboard variable.

Let's go back to `Hosts info` dashboard, and see what has changed to the variables selector row.

<img src={require('@/img/docs/tutorial/variable-selector.jpg').default.src} alt="variable-selector" style={{height: '30px'}} className="rounded-lg ring-1 ring-black/5" />

Yep, opposite to dashboard variable, global variable appeared in the right side of varaibles selector row.

Now, you should visit `Home` dashboard and `User stats` dashboard to confirm `host` variable is there too.


## Select once changes everywhere 

The most important feature of global variable is : if you set `host` to value `A` in one dashbaord, then all the other dashboard will also set `host` to `A`.

Let's try it, first, in `Hosts info` dashboard, set host to `localhost:9100`, then switch to `Home` and `User stats` dashboard to see its value, you should see: 

<img src={require('@/img/docs/tutorial/gvar-in-host-info.jpg').default.src} alt="gvar-in-host-info" style={{height: '50px'}} className="rounded-lg ring-1 ring-black/5" />
<img src={require('@/img/docs/tutorial/gvar-in-home.jpg').default.src} alt="gvar-in-home" style={{height: '50px'}} className="rounded-lg ring-1 ring-black/5" />
<img src={require('@/img/docs/tutorial/gvar-in-user-stats.jpg').default.src} alt="gvar-in-user-stats" style={{height: '50px'}} className="rounded-lg ring-1 ring-black/5" />

Great, they are changed to the same value as we expected.
