For timeseries data, the most used panel is `Graph` visualization.

Its x-axis is always time, and y-axis is the value of the metric, because of this, the `Graph` panel is the born for [timeseries data](/docs/panel-data-transform).


<img src={require('@/img/docs/plugin/graph.jpg').default.src} alt="graph" style={{height: '300px'}} className="rounded-lg ring-1 ring-black/5" />

Next, let's see how to configure some of the options.

## Connect null values 

When query data from datasource, if there is no data in some time points, the panel will show a gap in the graph.

<img src={require('@/img/docs/plugin/null-data.jpg').default.src} alt="null-data" style={{height: '300px'}} className="rounded-lg ring-1 ring-black/5" />

There many gaps in this graph, if hover on one of them, you should see a tootip with no value as the above image.

If we checked the `Connect null values` option in `Graph styles` section, the panel will connect the null values with the adjacent values.
