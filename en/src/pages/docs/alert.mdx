You can't configure alerts rules in Datav, because we believe: leave professional work to professional people. 

In you use Prometheus, you can create alerts rules in Prometheus, if you have your own APM services, you can create alerts in these systems. 

Datav is mainly focus on Alert dispaly. There are two ways to display alerts in Datav:

<TextList>
    <li>Viewing alerts in alert page</li>
    <li>Correlate alerts to centain panel</li>
</TextList>


For more info about first one, please read [here](/docs/tutorial-alert#alert-dashboard).
