If you want to show or hide a panel based on a condition, you can read this doc.

<video controls autoPlay src="/docs/condition-demo.mov" style={{width: "100%"}}/>

From this short video, we can see: there are two panels in the dashboard, one is NodeGraph panel, the other one is Table panel, they both 
show the dependency graph from Jaeger in different view type, and they are both very useful.

But we don't want to show both of them at the same time, because it will occupy too much space in the dashboard.So we need to show or hide them based on a given condition.


## Prerequisite

Before we start, we need to do some preparation:

1. Deployed Jaeger
2. Add jaeger datasource in Datav 
3. Using hotrod provided by Jaeger to generate some traces

> These are not required, but if you want to follow this doc step by step, you need to do them
>
> If you only want to try conditional rendering, you can create two panels with any kind visualization you like, and start from step `Add a condition`



## Create two panels 

### Create NodeGraph panel

Add a new panel and select `NodeGraph` visualization for it, then set its datasource to Jaeger, you should see:

<img src={require('@/img/docs/panel/nodegraph-jaeger.jpg').default.src} alt="panel/nodegraph-jaeger" width={3086} height={1658} className="rounded-lg ring-1 ring-black/5" />

### Create Table panel 

Add another panel and select `Table` visualization for it, then set its datasource to Jaeger, you should see:

<img src={require('@/img/docs/panel/table-jaeger.jpg').default.src} alt="panel/table-jaeger" width={3086} height={1658} className="rounded-lg ring-1 ring-black/5" />


Return back to dashboard page, as you can see, there are two panels show in the dashboard.

## Add a condition 

For now, we can only use variables as condition, therefore, let's create a dashboard variable named `view` and it has two values: `nodegraph` and `table`.

> If you forget how to create variable with custom values, please read [this doc](/docs/tutorial-variables#create-a-variable).

## Set condition for panels 

We need to set condition for both panels, so let's start with the NodeGraph panel.

Open panel editor of NodeGraph panel, and click `Panel` tab, expand `Basic Setting` section and find `Conditional Render`, then fill it as below:


<img src={require('@/img/docs/panel/nodegraph-condition.jpg').default.src} alt="panel/table-jaeger" style={{height: "400px"}} className="rounded-lg ring-1 ring-black/5" />

Condition value `view=nodegraph` means only render this panel when `view` variable is set to `nodegraph`.

Do the same thing to `Table` panel, but set condition value to `view=table`.

## Test it

All right, that't it, very simple, now we can test it as the first video shows: 
try to change `view` variable value to `nodegraph` or `table`, and see what happens.
