title: Organize dashboards with team 
description: 
---

Let's assume you have deploy a xobserve server in your Company, as the time goes on, you will have more and more dashboards and users.

In this case, you may want to organize your dashboards with different groups, so that you and other admins/users can easily manage them.

This kind group is called Team in xObserve.

## Why we need teams 

In a company, there is usually a team called ops, which is responsible for the operation and maintenance of the infrastructures, such as servers, databases, netword etc. 

If the ops team uses xObserve, they may want to create a team to manage their dashboards, because they probably don't care the dashboards about business.

Therefore, we can create a team called ops, and add all the ops users to this team, and associated server, network dashboards with this team.

## Create a ops team

1. Click `configuration` icon in the bottom section of sidebar and select `Team` tab.

2. Click `New Team` button in the top right corner 
3. Fill in `Team Name` field with `ops`
4. Click `Submit` button

That's unbelievable easy.

## Add users to ops team

Every team should has its own admins and users, so that they can manage and view their dashboards. 

Let's add `xobserve-admin` to ops team, add give him the admin role.

> In fact, if a user is `Admin` in `global` team, he is also the admin of xObserve, so we can get a conclusion: 
> `global` admins are also the admins of all teams.

1. Select `Member` tab in `ops` team page and click `New member` button

<img src={require('@/img/docs/tutorial/add-team-member.jpg').default.src} alt="add-team-member"  className="rounded-lg ring-1 ring-black/5"  style={{height: "300px"}} />

2. Login with `xobserve-admin` to complete next steps.


## Create a dashboard 

Now, let's create a dashboard for ops team. 

Select `Dashboard` tab in `ops` team page, and click the `New Dashboard` button. It seems there is no difference than before.

But if you look at `Belong to team` field, you can find that value has automatically set to `ops` team rather than the previous `global` team.

Sure, you can change it to `global` team, but this is no sense for our cases, so keep it to `opt` team.

<img src={require('@/img/docs/tutorial/add-team-dashboard.jpg').default.src} alt="add-team-dashboard"  className="rounded-lg ring-1 ring-black/5"  style={{height: "300px"}} />

Click `Submit` button to create our `Network stat` dashboard.

Look at the top left corner of the new dashboard, there shows that our new `Network stat` is `ops` team , great! Try to click on `ops` text and see what happens.

<img src={require('@/img/docs/tutorial/dashboard-lef-top-corner.jpg').default.src} alt="dashboard-lef-top-corner"  className="rounded-lg ring-1 ring-black/5"  style={{height: "50px"}} />


As this is just for demonstration purpose, we will not create any charts in this dashboard, but you can do it by yourself.


## Transfer dashbaord to ops team

First dashboard is ok, let's get the second one, this time , we are not creating a dashboard, we want to get back our rightfully dashboard : `Hosts info dashboard`, because it's all about servers :)

So we need to transfer that dashboard to `ops` team, but xObserve does not privide any transfer operation at this moment, we need to find a way to do this.

### Dashboard meta data 

In xobserve, all settings include panel settings are described in a JSON format, we call that: `dashboard meta data`.

If you are familiar with these settings, you can modify dashboard settings directly in meta data. 

Because there is no other way to transfer dashboard to a team, we have to modify the `ownedBy` field in meta data.

### Modify meta data 

First, we need to know the team id of `ops`: visit `/cfg/teams` page, and get it from teams table. 

In this situation, id of `ops` should be `2`, because we have not created any teams yet, and id of `global` team is `1`.

1. Visit `Hosts info` dashboard and open its settings modal.
2. Select `Meta data` tab 
3. Set the value of  `ownedBy` field to `2`

<img src={require('@/img/docs/tutorial/dashboard-metadata.jpg').default.src} alt="dashboard-metadata"  className="rounded-lg ring-1 ring-black/5"  width={3086} height={1658}/>

4. Click `Submit` button

Go back to dashboard page, you should see :

<img src={require('@/img/docs/tutorial/dashboard-new-owner.jpg').default.src} alt="dashboard-new-owner"  className="rounded-lg ring-1 ring-black/5"  style={{height: "50px"}} />

This means we have successfully transferred `Hosts info` dashboard to `ops` team.

To ensure that, you can open search panel to see if `Hosts info` dashboard is in `ops` team.

<img src={require('@/img/docs/tutorial/new-owner-show-in-search.jpg').default.src} alt="new-owner-show-in-search"  className="rounded-lg ring-1 ring-black/5"  width={3086} height={1658}/>


## Create sidebar

Now, we have two dashboards in `ops` team, but we can't see them in sidebar, visit by search is not a good choice, especially for enterprise use cases.

So let's created a sidebar for `ops` team.

1. Click `configuration` icon in sidebar and select `Team` tab
2. Click `manage` button on `ops` row 
3. Select `Side menu` tab 

You can see there is already a menu item navigate to `Home` dashboard, but why can't we see it? 

Don't worry, we will cover it later, for now, just create our sidebar menu items.

<img src={require('@/img/docs/tutorial/team-sidebar.jpg').default.src} alt="team-sidebar"  className="rounded-lg ring-1 ring-black/5"  width={3086} height={1658}/>


Now, sidebar for `ops` team has been created, but we are still using the sidebar from global menu.

## Switch sidebar

To use the new `ops` sidebar, we need to switch the sidebar to `ops`.

Click `user` icon at bottom of sidebar and hover on `Select sidemenu` item,you should see : 

<img src={require('@/img/docs/tutorial/select-sidebar.jpg').default.src} alt="select-sidebar"  className="rounded-lg ring-1 ring-black/5"  style={{height: "300px"}} />


You see, just click the `ops` item, and the sidebar will be switched to `ops`.

Once selected, each time you access xObserve, the sidebar will be `ops` sidebar, until you switch to another sidebar.
