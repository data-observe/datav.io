Loki is a great product developed by Grafana, it's like Prometheus but for logs. It's a great tool to have in your observability stack.

In this doc, let's see how to query variables from <Code>Loki</Code>.


## Configture loki datasource 

Create loki datasource is really easy: 

<img src={require('@/img/docs/variable/loki-datasource.jpg').default.src} alt="loki-datasource"  className="rounded-lg ring-1 ring-black/5" style={{height: "300px"}} />

## Query variables

Query variables from loki is very similar to Prometheus. So you can refer to [Make dashboard more dynamic](/docs/tutorial-variables#query-from-datasource) for more details.

## Final result 

<img src={require('@/img/docs/variable/loki-final1.jpg').default.src} alt="loki-final1"  className="rounded-lg ring-1 ring-black/5" style={{height: "500px"}} />
