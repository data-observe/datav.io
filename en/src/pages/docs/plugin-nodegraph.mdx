import Code  from '@/components/docs/Code'

## Filter

There is a toolbox in the top left corner of `NodeGraph`, the most useful one is the fitler tool. You can use it to filter the nodes and edges you want.


<img src={require('@/img/docs/plugin/filter-nodes.jpg').default.src} alt="filter-nodes" width={3086} height={1658} className="rounded-lg ring-1 ring-black/5" />

In above image, we set a filter rule to match `node-1` and `node-2` nodes.

If you want see the relation nodes of them, check `Show realtion`:


<img src={require('@/img/docs/plugin/filter-relation.jpg').default.src} alt="filter-relation" width={3086} height={1658} className="rounded-lg ring-1 ring-black/5" />


### Enable/disalbe 

The filter rules you set is automatically store in browser local storage, if you don't need them, you can remove or just disable them:

<img src={require('@/img/docs/plugin/enable-filter.jpg').default.src} alt="enable-filter" width={3086} height={1658} className="rounded-lg ring-1 ring-black/5" />

You can see that when we disalbed the rule by clicking the `eye icon`, all the nodes and edges are shown now.


## Donut colors

Nodes in `NodeGraph` panel are all render in <Code>Donut</Code> shapes, you can define own colors for them.

Let's assume your [node data format](/docs/panel-data-transform#nodegraph-format) is like this: 

```json
"data": {
    "success": 72,
    "error": 28
}
```

Then you can set donut colors as below: 

<img src={require('@/img/docs/plugin/donut-setting.jpg').default.src} alt="donut-setting" style={{height: '300px'}} className="rounded-lg ring-1 ring-black/5" />

And the result is:

<img src={require('@/img/docs/plugin/donut-color.jpg').default.src} alt="donut-color" width={3086} height={1658} className="rounded-lg ring-1 ring-black/5" />


## Table View

Sometimes, dependency data in table format is very useful, for how to change view between NodeGraph and Table panel, please refer to [Conditional rendering](/docs/panel-conditional-rendering).



## Set node size by passing data

User can control the size of node by passing in data with `size` field in `node`, for example: 

```json
{
    "id": "node-1",
    "label": "Node1",
    "data": {
        "success": 100,
        "error": 10
    },
    "size": 100,
    "show": true,
    "text": "100}\n10"
}
```

The above JSON is getting through HTTP datasource from one of user services, the `size` field is used to control the size of node. If you don't set `size` field, the node size will be set automatically according to `baseSize` and `maxSize` config of `NodeGraph`.
