There are two ways to remove external plugins, we recommend that general users use the first method.
If you are a plugin developer or encounter unexpected situations, you can use the second method.

## Remove through script

Let's remove the panel plugin `demo` installed in previous chapters through the script:

1. Enter the `ui/external-plugins` directory of the Datav source code and run the following script

```bash 
go run removePlugin.go panel.demo
```

When you see the `Remove plugins successfully!` prompt, it means that the plugin has been successfully removed.

> Note that the script will not delete the source code under `ui/external-plugins/panel`, if you do not manually delete the source code, the next time you run the plugins install script, the plugin will still be installed


### Remove multiple plugins at the same time

If you want to delete multiple plugins at the same time, it is strongly recommended to complete it in the same script call.
Since some limitations in the current implementation, if you delete a plugin and do not delete its source code directory, it will continue to be installed when you delete the next plugin!!

```bash 
go run removePlugin.go panel.demo,datasource.demo
```

The above statement will delete the `demo` plugin of the panel type and the `demo` plugin of the data source type at the same time.

## Manually remove

You can also manually delete the plugin, take the datasource plugin `demo` as an example.

1. Enter `ui/public/plugins/external/datasource` directory
2. Delete `demo.svg` icon
3. Modify `plugins.json` to remove string: `{"type":"demo"}`
4. Enter `ui/src/views/dashboard/plugins/external` directory
5. Modify `plugins.ts` and remove `import DemoDatasrouceComponents from "./datasource/demo"`, `"demo": DemoDatasrouceComponents,`.
6. Enter `ui/src/views/dashboard/plugins/external/datasource` directory
7. Delete `demo` directory

Up to now, the `demo` data source plugin has been deleted. The steps you manually completed are exactly the same as the steps executed by the `removePlugin.go` script. 

Therefore, if you don't need the plugin, don't forget to manually delete the source code directory of the plugin `ui/external-plugins/datasource/demo`.
