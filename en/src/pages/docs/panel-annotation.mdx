Using annotatin can add marks to your Graph panel chart, like this: 

<img src={require('@/img/docs/panel/annotation-demo1.jpg').default.src} alt="annotation-demo1" style={{height: '300px'}} className="rounded-lg ring-1 ring-black/5" />

The line and range with sky blue color are our annotations. Let's create an annotation first.

> Annotation is only support in <Code>Graph</Code> panel

## Annotation

### Create annotation 

1. Add a new panel and open its panel editor, then select `Grapn` visualization for it, apply and return back to dashboard page.
2. Click on the Graph chart, you will see a context menu popup:

<img src={require('@/img/docs/panel/annotation-context-menu.jpg').default.src} alt="annotation-context-menu" style={{height: '300px'}} className="rounded-lg ring-1 ring-black/5" />

3. Click `Add annotation` button, you will see a annotation editor popup:

<img src={require('@/img/docs/panel/annotation-editor.jpg').default.src} alt="annotation-editor" style={{height: '300px'}} className="rounded-lg ring-1 ring-black/5" />

4. `Duration` field is the time range of annotation, if you want the annotation to be a vertical line, set it to `0s`, otherwise set to the real timerange ,
let's set it to `2m` here

Fill in other fields and click `Submit` button, you will see the annotation in the chart.

<img src={require('@/img/docs/panel/annotation-hover.jpg').default.src} alt="annotation-hover" style={{height: '300px'}} className="rounded-lg ring-1 ring-black/5" />

### View annotation

In above image, we can see an arrow points to a marker, if you hover on the marker, you will see the annotation details popup like the image above.

### Edit annotation

Click the `edit icon` in the top right corner of the popup annotation detail card, you will see the annotation editor appeared.

We can edit annotation infos and timerange here, let's change the `Duration` to `1m` now, and see what will happen.


### Delete annotation 

Click the `trash icon` in the top right corner of the popup annotation detail card to delete the annotation.


## Manage panel annotations 

Manage annotation through chart is not convenient, so xObserve provides a panel annotation manager to manage all annotations.

1. Click panel header(click where the arrow points to in below image) and click `Panel Debug` menu item 

<img src={require('@/img/docs/panel/debug-panel-menu.jpg').default.src} alt="debug-panel-menu" style={{height: '300px'}} className="rounded-lg ring-1 ring-black/5" />

2. Select `Panel Annotations` tab 

Now you will see all the annotations in this panel and current selected time range

## Annotation settings

Open dashboard settings modal, select `Annotation` tab, you will see the annotation settings.

<img src={require('@/img/docs/panel/annotation-setting.jpg').default.src} alt="annotation-setting" style={{height: '300px'}} className="rounded-lg ring-1 ring-black/5" />

You can try:

<TextList>
    <li>change the color of annotation markers</li>
    <li>add tags to some annotations, and set the `tags filter setting` to only show the annotations which matched the tags</li>
</TextList>


## Correlate alert with panels

In previous [tutorial](/docs/tutorial-alert#correlate-alerts-to-graph-panel), we have learned how to create an alert to `Graph` panel, these alerts are shown as annotations, but you can't edit them,
because they are automatically created by xObserve, not by user.
