import TextList  from '@/components/docs/TextList'
import Code  from '@/components/docs/Code'

The dashboards we created before are static, which means values are statically written. 

A prometheus query <Code>{'go_gc_duration_seconds{job="node"}'}</Code> is a static query string, what if we want to query another job? We have to change the query string to 
 <Code>{'go_gc_duration_seconds{job="prometheus"}'}</Code> , that's not convenient for a lot of cases.

So, it's time to introduce some features to make our dashboard dynamic. In this doc, we will make the dashboard more dynamic by adding variables.


## Create a variable 

There are two kinds of variables: dashboard variable and global variable. Let's start from dashboard variable first.

1. Visit `Hosts info` dashboard and open its settings modal, select `Variables` tab.
2. Click `New Variable` button, you will see a modal like this:

<img src={require('@/img/docs/tutorial/dashboard-variable.jpg').default.src} alt="dashboard-variable"  className="rounded-lg ring-1 ring-black/5" style={{height: "400px"}} />

wow, it seems complex, but don't worry, let's start from a simple one :)

In this secion, our target is to make `job` dynamic, as it has two values: `node` and `prometheus`, we need to create a variable also has these two values.

3. Fill the form like this: 

<img src={require('@/img/docs/tutorial/edit-job-variable.jpg').default.src} alt="edit-job-variable"  className="rounded-lg ring-1 ring-black/5" style={{height: "400px"}} />

Look at he `Variable Values` field, this is the result that our variable query returns, so if you see values listing here, it means our variable is probably created successfully(maybe wrong values).

The `job` variable we are creating is a `Custom` type variable, its values comes from our input string, each value is separated by a comma, e.g `1,2,3` means we have three values: `1`, `2`, `3`.

4. Click `Submit` button, you will see a new variable named `job` in the `Variables` tab


> Don't forget to save dashboard ! Everthing you changed in the dashboard will not be saved.


Now close the setting modal, you will see a new dropdown list appears in the top left corner of the dashboard, it's our `job` variable.

<img src={require('@/img/docs/tutorial/job-variable.jpg').default.src} alt="job-variable"  className="rounded-lg ring-1 ring-black/5" style={{height: "100px"}} />


## Use variable 

In this section, we will use the variable we created in previous section.

### Use variable in query
Now open the editor of panel `go gc info`, change the query string to `go_gc_duration_seconds{job="${job}"}`, then click `Apply` button.

Because `job` variable is automatically set to `node`, so our `go gc info` panel will show the data of `node` job, the same as <Code>{'go_gc_duration_seconds{job="node"}'}</Code>.

<img src={require('@/img/docs/tutorial/chart-with-job-var.jpg').default.src} alt="chart-with-job-var"  className="rounded-lg ring-1 ring-black/5" style={{height: "300px"}} />

Try to change the value of `job` variable to `prometheus`, and see what will happen to the chart data.



### Variable format

`${job}` in the query string is a variable format, it will be replaced by the value of variable `job` when the query is executed. You can use as many as variables in the query string, e.g <Code>{'go_gc_duration_seconds{job="${job}", instance="${instance}"}'}</Code>.

### Use variable in panel title 

Variable can be used in many places, usually there will be a `Support variables` tips in the input box. 

Because our panel is dependent on variable `job`, so we can add it to panel title so that we can know which job we are currently viewing.

Modify the panel title to `go gc info - ${job}`:

<img src={require('@/img/docs/tutorial/variable-in-panel-title.jpg').default.src} alt="variable-in-panel-title"  className="rounded-lg ring-1 ring-black/5" style={{height: "100px"}} />



### Multi value and All 

What if we want show use multiple variable values in query? Maybe you can create multiple variables, but it's not a good idea. 

The better way is to enalbe `Multi Value` or `Include all` options for variable, thus we can select multiple values from variable dropdown list.

Modify `job` variable as below: 

<img src={require('@/img/docs/tutorial/job-var-enable-multi.jpg').default.src} alt="job-var-enable-multi"  className="rounded-lg ring-1 ring-black/5" style={{height: "300px"}} />

Back to dashboard page, you will see the `job` variable dropdown switches to multiple selection mode, and there is a new option `__all__` in the dropdown.

Try to select all or select both `node` and `prometheus`, you will see....nothing?

Yep, you will see nothing in the chart, because the query string is <Code>{'go_gc_duration_seconds{job="${job}"}'}</Code>, it's not a valid query string when `job` variable has multiple values.

According to the [Prometheus document](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/#instant-vector-selectors), we should  modify our query string to `go_gc_duration_seconds{job=~"${job}"}`.

Modify the query string to see the result as below image: 

<img src={require('@/img/docs/tutorial/query-support-multi-var.jpg').default.src} alt="query-support-multi-var"  className="rounded-lg ring-1 ring-black/5"  width={3086} height={1658}/>


## Query from datasource

In previous section, we are using variable query from a manually inputing string, what if we want to get some values from external services, like Prometheus datasource?

Let's create a new variable named `instance` to query all instance names from Prometheus.

1. Open the settings modal of `Hosts info` dashboard, select `Variables` tab, click `New Variable` button.
2. Fill the form like this:

<img src={require('@/img/docs/tutorial/edit-instance-var.jpg').default.src} alt="edit-instance-var"  className="rounded-lg ring-1 ring-black/5" style={{height: "400px"}} />

We do several things here:

1. Set `Query Type` field to `Query`, it means query from configured datasources.
2. Select datasource `Prometheus` 
3. Set `Use current time` to `On`, it means the query will be executed within the current time range being selected, otherwise if you set it to `Off`,  the query will bring no timerange, maybe you will get values from months even years ago.
4. Because we want get the values of label `instance` , so select `Label values` for `Query type` field.
5. If `Metric` field is left empty, the query will return all values of all metrics for `instance` label. Therefore we can specify a metric name here, such as <Code>go_gc_duration_seconds</Code>. However, for demonstration purpose, we will leave this field empty.
6. Set `Label`field to `instance`


Now let's modify the query string of `go gc info` panel to <Code>{'go_gc_duration_seconds{job=~"$\{job\}", instance=~"${instance}"}`'}</Code>, and see what will happen.

> Try to change `job` variable from using Custom query to datasource query


## Make datasource dynamic 

Currently, we select datasource directly in panel editor, what if we have multiple datasources in different data center and we want to select datasource dynamically?

Before we start, let's create a new datasource named `prometheus1` first:

<img src={require('@/img/docs/tutorial/prometheus1-ds.jpg').default.src} alt="prometheus1-ds"  className="rounded-lg ring-1 ring-black/5"  width={3086} height={1658}/>

Then visit `Hosts info` dashboard, and open its variable editor, create a new variable named `datasource`:

<img src={require('@/img/docs/tutorial/edit-ds-variable.jpg').default.src} alt="edit-ds-variable"  className="rounded-lg ring-1 ring-black/5" style={{height: "500px"}} />

There are several things we need to pay attention to:

<TextList>
    <li>`Multi and All` options all only supported by some places, datasource selection is not one of those, so we need to set theme to `off`</li>
    <li>Set `Query type` to `Datasource`</li>
    <li>Use `Regex filter` to filter out `TestData` datasource, because we don't want to select it</li>
</TextList>


This varialbe is easy to created, now let's use it in panel edtitor.

Open panel editor of `go gc info` panel, and find the `Datasource` dropdown in `Query` tab: 

<img src={require('@/img/docs/tutorial/use-ds-variable.jpg').default.src} alt="use-ds-variable"  className="rounded-lg ring-1 ring-black/5" style={{height: "300px"}} />

Don't select any datasource here, we need to input <Code>{'${datasource}'}</Code>  to use our `datasource` variable.

<img src={require('@/img/docs/tutorial/input-datasource-var.jpg').default.src} alt="input-datasource-var"  className="rounded-lg ring-1 ring-black/5" style={{height: "200px"}} />

Press `Enter` key to confirm, then input <Code>{'go_gc_duration_seconds{job=~"${job}", instance=~"${instance}"}'}</Code> as query string.

> Change datasource will cause the previous query to be cleared, so you'd better copy it first before changing  datasource.

Apply the changes and go back to dashboard page, change the value of `datasource` variable, you will see the chart data.. not changes, because we use the same datasource indeed.


**Here is an excercise for our readers**: try to add back `TestData` datasource, and change the value of `datasource` variable between `prometheus` and `TestData`, you will see the chart data changes.

## Use variable in querying variable 

When querying a variable, we can use another variable as input. 

First, create a new variable named metrics :

<img src={require('@/img/docs/tutorial/metrics-variable.jpg').default.src} alt="metrics-variable"  className="rounded-lg ring-1 ring-black/5" style={{height: "500px"}} />

We query metrics from Prometheus datasource, and filter the metrics starts with `go_gc`.

### More dynamic panel query

Before using `metrics` variable in query another variable, we can update our panel query to use it to make our panel query more dynamic.

Open panel editor, input <Code>{'${metrics}{job=~"${job}", instance=~"${instance}"}'}</Code> in `Query` tab:


<img src={require('@/img/docs/tutorial/dynamic-query.jpg').default.src} alt="dynamic-query"  className="rounded-lg ring-1 ring-black/5"  width={3086} height={1658}/>

Click `Apply` button and go back to dashboard page, then select different `metrics` variable value to see what happens.

It seems our dashbaord is much more powerful than before, great job !

### use in variable query 

Now, let's edit the `instance` variable created in previous section, rename it to `metrics name` and uses `metrics` variable as `Metric` field input:

<img src={require('@/img/docs/tutorial/rename-instance-var.jpg').default.src} alt="rename-instance-var"  className="rounded-lg ring-1 ring-black/5" style={{height: "500px"}} />

You can see, in `Query -> Metric` field , rather than select a value from dropdown, we use the value from variable `metrics` as input. 

Try to change the value of `metrics` variable, and see how `metrics name` variable changes.
