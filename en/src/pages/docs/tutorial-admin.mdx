title: Admin is dangerous 
description: 
---

Do you still remember we are login with default `admin` user? The worse thing is that default password is `admin` too.

`admin` user in ObserveX has all privileges, the role of `admin` is `Super Admin`, other users can never set to this role.

As a result,  `admin` can do everthing , therefore, it's not safe to use `admin` user in production environment, it's even dangerous to use `admin` as password :(

So, let's start with changing password.

## Change password 

1. Click `user` icon in the bottom of sidebar and select `Account setting`.
2. Fill in the forms in `Change Password` section 
3. Click `Submit`

When you change password, you will be logout automatically, you need to login again with new password.

### I forget `admin` password 

If you forget `admin` password, you have to manually set it to empty string  in database, don't set to any other strings, as the password is encrypted. 

Once re-login `admin` with empty password, you must **change it to a new one for safety** !


## Create a new Admin user 

Another way is to create a new user and assign him with `Admin` role.

1. Click `configuration` icon in the bottom of sidebar and select `User` tab

<img src={require('@/img/docs/tutorial/user-table.jpg').default.src} alt="user table" width={3086} height={1658} className="rounded-lg ring-1 ring-black/5" />

2. Click `New User` button in the top right corner
3. Let's create a user named `observex-admin` with password `observex-admin` and role `Admin`

<img src={require('@/img/docs/tutorial/add-user.jpg').default.src} alt="add user" style={{height: '300px'}}  />

4. Click `Submit` button

Now, you can login with `observex-admin` and `observex-admin` password. This user can also manage observex as `admin` user.
