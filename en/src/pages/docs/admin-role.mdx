Every user in Datav is assinged a role. The role determines what the user can do. 

There are currenly 3 roles in Datav: 

<TextList>
    <li> Super admin </li>
    <li> Admin </li>
    <li> Viewer </li>
</TextList>

## Super admin 

Among these roles, super admin is very special: only `admin` user is `Super admin` role, it's hard coded in Datav, 
therefor you cant chagne the username and role of `admin` user.

`Super admin` has all the permissions in Datav, including manage `Admin` users and teams.

## Team role 

`Admin` role can create teams, add users to that team and assign team roles to them.

There are 2 team roles: 
<TextList>
    <li> Admin: manage team user, dashboards and settings </li>
    <li> Viewer: view team info, dashboards and use team sidebar </li>
</TextList>

Here is an intresting thing: in fact, there are no user roles in Datav, only team roles. Let's see how it works.

## Datav and global team

For some reasons, user roles in Datav are just roles in `global` team.

<img src={require('@/img/docs/admin/user-roles.jpg').default.src} alt="user-roles"  className="rounded-lg ring-1 ring-black/5"  style={{height: '260px'}}/>

As you can see, this is the user configuration page, the roles of user are actually geting from `global` team.

Let's check the global team :

<img src={require('@/img/docs/admin/global-roles.jpg').default.src} alt="global-roles"  className="rounded-lg ring-1 ring-black/5"  style={{height: '260px'}}/>

They are almost the same, except that there is no `Super admin` in `global` team, because `Super admin` is only assigned to `admin` user, it is hard coded.

By the way, we even have not added `datav-admin` to `global` team, when we add this user and assigned `Admin` role to him, he is actually added to `global` team with the same role.

In a word, **every user you add in Datav is actually added to `gloal` team, when you set role for a user, you are just set his role in `global` team, and vice versa**.

## Admin role

Admin role can do many things in `Datav`, therefore we recommand you to manage `Datav` using `Admin` role user.

There is something you need to know about Admin role:

<TextList>
    <li> Admin( or global team admin) can manage a team, even he is not in that team </li>
    <li> Admin can't manage another admin user, only Super admin can do so </li>
</TextList>

## Who can edit a dashboard?

Currently, only team admin (team that dashboard belongs to) can save a dashboard.

Viewer can only view and edit a dashboard, but they can not save it. 

Maybe we will introduce more roles in the future, such as `Edtidor` role, who can edit and save a dashboard, but can not manage team users and settings.
