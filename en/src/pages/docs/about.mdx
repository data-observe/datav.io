xObserve is a modern data visualization platform, built in 2023, that enables deep visualization and interactivity of Metrics, Traces, and Logs data.

**You can build any Observability and APM ( Application Performance Management ) UI you want based on xObserve, if you cannot, please file an issue and we will support it as soon as possible.**

Unlike other general-purpose data visualization platforms, xObserve is mainly focus on Observability and APM, and it has many cool features for you to build your own Observablity UI.


## Core features

Grafana is a great product and the most popular dashboarding tool in the world, and xObserve has borrowed many of its features, besides these, xObserve has its own advantages:

1. **Native support for observability and APM**
  
 - **Built in powerful Metrics, Traces and Logs panels**
 - **Support beautiful large data screen**, you can customize dashboards and panel styles as you like.
 - **Customizable sidebar menu**, the sidebar in Grafana is unchangeable, but xObserve gives you plenty of options, you can even create different sidebar menu  for different teams!
 - **Global variable**ï¼ŒFor APM platforms, global variables are very important, when you choose an environment, application or a host, you may want to select in one place, but effect everywhere.
 - **Built in general HTTP datasource and Echarts panel**, you can query and build anything you want with them.
 - **Powerful data transformation**, in some cases, the data query from datasource is not exactly what you want, for these cases you can customize the data transformation in xObserve, and converted the query result into any format and form you want.

    In a word, you can use xObserve to build any kinds of APM UI! We provide you nearly all the tools you need.

  

2. **Quick response and development of new features and bugs**

   Some products are constrained by its commercial product line, complex codebase and development process, therefore many features may take years to be responded, whereas xObserve is always ready to support them as long as they're reasonable.

3. **Rich settings for panels**
    
    xObserve provides lots of panel settings for you to build your own powerful panel.
   
4. **Unbelievable powerful interactivity**

    As an APM platform, drill-down and associative queries are essential, and xObserve provides customizable interactivity for this, almost all panel types can implement any kind of interactive events, such as the drill-down interaction `Metrics -> Trace -> Logs -> Traces` demonstrated in the following video:

5. **Outstanding performance and user experience**
   Codebase in xObserve are very clean and simple: we only use React.js and Vite.js and has taken a lot of optimizations to improve user experiences.


   xObserve is designed to be maintenance-friendly, dig into the code and be pleasantly surprised at how easy it is to modify.
   
6. **Beautiful and customizable UI**

    As xobserve is a new product, we have a chance to build a modern and beautiful UI from scratch. 

    You can customize dashboard and panel styles to build beautiful dashboard, such as building a large screen display, maybe your Boss will like it :)

7.  **Better open-source License**

    xObserve is using Apache License 2.0, which is more friendly to commercial use.
