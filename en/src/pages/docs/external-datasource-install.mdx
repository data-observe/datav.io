Install datasource plugin is almost the same as install panel plugin, the only difference is that the downloaded datasource plugin needs to be placed under `ui/external-plugins/datasource`.

You can install a datasource plugin: demo, which is the same as the built-in plugin Prometheus, in the same way as the previous chapter.

The final effect is as below:
